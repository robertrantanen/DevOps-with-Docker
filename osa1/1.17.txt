Docker hub link:

https://hub.docker.com/r/rantro/somepython

It's a Python image that installs all kinds of stuff with pip. The image also installs Oracle which is totally my favorite database. You can shell inside the container with:

docker run -it rantro/somepython

Then you can create new python files etc, or write "python3" to shell inside python.
